            Charminar stands tall in the heart of the city since 1591. It was
            built by Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah reflecting Cazia style.
            Charminar’s unique architecture and detailed design with four 48.7
            meter high minarets used to warn the king’s men, is something to
            marvel at! It is one of the most famous places to visit in
            Hyderabad. With Mecca Masjid, Bhagyalakshmi Temple Laad Bazaar and
            Meena Bazaar right beside the monument, you can witness the
            vividness of this city here. If you love history and street

              Falaknuma Palace is often referred to as the ‘Mirror of the sky’. The name speaks for itself! Made with white marble, this exquisitely designed palace is excellently maintained to date.
Designed by William Ward Marret, an English architect, this palace was first owned by the Paigah family, and later it was controlled by the Nizam of Hyderabad.
