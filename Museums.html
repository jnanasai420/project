                Sudha Car Museum was initially curated as a hobby and is a
                splendid automobile museum in Hyderabad. There is a vast display
                of unique cars resembling familiar objects from everyday life.
                Mr. K. Sudhakar makes all these cars, and this museum finds its
                place in the Limca Book of Records. There are cars shaped like
                helmets, beds, stilettos, lipsticks, handbags, etc. These cars
                are built using scrap material and are fully functional. With
                each of these cars, you can find a note with information
                regarding how the car was built; the duration taken to make it,
                and its speed. This museum is a favorite of kids, tech freaks,
                and automobile enthusiasts.

                The Telangana State Archaeology Museum is located inside the
                Hyderabad Public Garden. This museum gives you an insight into
                the culture of the two Telugu states. Archaeologist Henry
                Cousens discovered this museum in the 19th century. It was
                formerly known as Andhra Pradesh Archeology Museum or Hyderabad
                Museum. This museum helped in preserving the heritage of the
                region against the British. The efforts of the last Nizam of
                Hyderabad brought this museum into being. The structure houses
                decorative art pieces, arms, coins, Jain and Buddhist relics,
                bronze and stone sculptures, and other valuable stuff. This is
                Hyderabad's oldest museum and a must-visit place in the city.
                Make sure you see the 2000-year-old Egyptian mummy that is the
                highlight here.
