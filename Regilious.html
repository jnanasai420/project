              Birla Mandir stands tall in pristine white and enhances the
              skyline of Hyderabad. This Hindu temple was established in 1976 by
              Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. Built atop 280 feet
              high on Kala Pahad, Birla Mandir is spread across a 13-acre plot.
              With an 11 feet tall idol replica of Tirupati Venkateshwara, this
              temple also has an exotic architectural design, which includes
              visuals of scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata. The best
              panoramic views of the city, exquisite architecture and the
              peaceful vibrations of Birla Mandir make it one of the must-visit
              places to visit in Hyderabad. Location: Hill Fort Road Timings: 7

              This temple is located on the outskirts of the state capital, on
              the banks of the Osman Sagar Lake. The temple is definitely an
              epicenter of a great deal of spiritual energy. According to the
              history of this temple, almost all the IT professionals who visit
              the temple had received an opportunity to fly abroad within a
              year. The faith here is that if a you make a wish after 11
              pradakshanas, then that wish comes true. And once the wish comes
              true, you will have to come back to do 108 pradakshanas around the
              entire temple. Even the popular Wall Street Journal, amused with
              the belief, has written a full article on this temple. People from
              all sects visit this temple in hope of getting their wishes
              fulfilled. Another notable aspect of this temple is that it is one
              of the very few temples in the country, which does not accept any
              monetary donations in the Hundi. The management believes that the
              only fee the lord asks the devotees to make pradakshanas around
              the temple.

              Calvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today,
              it is India’s largest church, with over 300,000 members. It’s now
              on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next ten years.
              Pastor Dr Satish Kumar is the pastor of Calvary Temple. From the
              humblest of beginnings in 2005, it has grown to more than 300,000
              members today. Now, with eleven satellite churches, it’s India’s
              largest church – and one of the biggest in the world. But Pastor
              Kumar has no room for complacency and contentment. Instead, he has
              plans to begin 40 new mega-churches in the next ten years. With
              the church seeing 3,000 new believers every month, there is every
              indication such an ambitious plan will come to fruition.

              Makkah Masjid is one of the oldest and largest mosques in India.
              Located close to landmarks of Charminar, Laad Bazaar and
              Chowmahalla Palace, the mosque holds 400-year-old history in its
              bricks. The mosque gets its name from Macca, the holiest site for
              Muslims: The monument was constructed from the soil brought in
              from Mecca upon the order of the late Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the
              fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. The three arched facades
              were carved from a single piece of granite and it took more than
              8,000 workers to build the mosque. Location: Ghansi Bazaar,

              historical and architectural site. Built in the late 17th century
              during the reign of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, it was commissioned by
              Hayat Bakshi Begum, the wife of Sultan Muhammad Qutb Shah. The
              mosque is known for its stunning Persian and Mughal architectural
              influences, featuring intricate carvings, large domes, and a
